An AI-powered web application that predicts the **severity of software bugs** (Critical, High, Medium, Low) using a neural network classifier trained on historical bug-tracking data. Built with a FastAPI backend, a Streamlit frontend, JWT-based authentication, and role-based access for customers and admins.

## 📖 Overview

When a bug is reported in a software project, triaging it correctly — deciding how urgent it is — is a critical but time-consuming task. **Bug Severity Predictor** automates this by analyzing structured bug metadata (component, environment, affected users, response time, business impact, and more) and instantly predicting how severe the bug is, along with a confidence score for each possible severity class.

The app supports two types of users:

- **Customers** can submit bug details and get instant predictions, view their personal prediction history, and see their own analytics dashboard.
- **Admins** get a control panel with access to all predictions, all registered users, login activity logs, and aggregate statistics across the system.

## 🚀 Live Demo

| Component | URL |
|---|---|
| **Frontend (Streamlit)** | https://bug-severity-predictor-ag97h6mr8dcsnk3wkanw9w.streamlit.app/ |
| **Backend (FastAPI)** | https://bug-severity-predictor-ztsr.onrender.com |
| **API Docs (Swagger)** | https://bug-severity-predictor-ztsr.onrender.com/docs |

> ⚠️ Note: The backend runs on Render's free tier, so the first request after a period of inactivity may take 30-50 seconds while the server "wakes up." Subsequent requests will be fast.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** — JWT-based login/register system with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- 🎯 **AI-Powered Predictions** — Severity classification (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with per-class confidence scores
- 📊 **Interactive Visualizations** — Probability bar charts, severity distribution pie charts, and confidence box plots (Plotly)
- 📋 **Personal History** — Every user can filter, view, and download their own past predictions as CSV
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Admin Panel** — Admins can view all predictions, all users, login logs, and system-wide statistics
- 🌐 **Persistent Cloud Database** — All data (users, predictions, login logs) stored permanently in PostgreSQL (Supabase), surviving backend restarts and redeploys
- ⚡ **Lightweight ML Model** — Uses scikit-learn's MLPClassifier instead of a heavy deep learning framework, keeping memory usage low enough to run on free-tier cloud hosting

The frontend never talks to the database or the model directly — every interaction goes through the FastAPI backend, which handles authentication, prediction logic, and data persistence.

## 🧠 How the Model Works

1. **Input features** — 31 fields describing a bug: its type, the affected component, environment, platform, OS, browser, who reported it, current status, plus numeric/behavioral metrics like affected users, response time, business impact score, reproduction rate, memory/CPU usage, fix time, reopen count, and security/SLA flags.
2. **Preprocessing** — Categorical fields are label-encoded; all features are scaled using a `StandardScaler` fitted during training.
3. **Model** — A Multi-Layer Perceptron (`MLPClassifier`) with hidden layers `(256, 128, 64, 32)`, ReLU activation, and L2 regularization, trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
4. **Output** — A predicted severity class (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`) along with a probability distribution across all four classes, which the frontend renders as a confidence score and a bar chart.

The model achieves **~91% accuracy** on a held-out test set.

> **Why scikit-learn instead of a deep learning framework?** The model was originally trained as a TensorFlow/Keras ANN. However, TensorFlow's memory footprint exceeded the limits of free-tier cloud hosting, causing the deployed API to crash. Re-training the same architecture as a scikit-learn `MLPClassifier` preserved comparable accuracy while reducing memory usage enough to run reliably on free infrastructure — a common trade-off when deploying ML models under resource constraints.

## 💻 Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- A PostgreSQL database (Supabase free tier works well) **or** modify `database.py` to use SQLite for local-only testing

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gagan6571/bug-severity-predictor.git
cd bug-severity-predictor
```

### 2. Set up the backend
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables) with:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Run the backend:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Set up the frontend
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Update `API_URL` in `streamlit_app.py` to point to `http://localhost:8000` for local development.

### 4. (Optional) Retrain the model
```bash
cd model
python train_sklearn.py
```

## ☁️ Deployment

| Component | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend API** | [Render](https://render.com) (Free Web Service) | Root directory left blank; start command: `uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000` |
| **Frontend** | [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io) | Main file path: `frontend/streamlit_app.py`; uses its own lightweight `requirements.txt` |
| **Database** | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (Free PostgreSQL) | Connected via the **Transaction Pooler** connection string for IPv4 compatibility with Render |

Environment variables required on the backend host:
```
DATABASE_URL=<your Supabase transaction pooler connection string>
```

> **Note on Render's free tier:** The service spins down after periods of inactivity and "cold starts" on the next request, which can take up to a minute. This is expected behavior on the free plan, not a bug.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add password reset / forgot-password flow
- Move secrets fully to environment variables across all environments
- Add automated CI tests on push (GitHub Actions)
- Add pagination for large prediction history tables
- Containerize the backend with Docker for more portable deployment
- Add model versioning so retrained models can be rolled back if needed
